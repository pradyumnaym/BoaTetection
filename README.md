This is the code we used for the MaCVi [BoaTetection challenge](https://macvi.org/leaderboard/surface/BoaTetection/BoaTetection?primaryMetric=AR_1) during the winter break (WiSe 2023/24) at University of TÃ¼bingen. You can find the details of our strategy in the [presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ACOg5uyMg0wR7PBCltHcXq-Y4ygBIBgNnwtscv88sbQ/edit?usp=sharing).




### Combining datasets.

1. Download the [Sibenik dataset](https://mega.nz/file/wAk3zbyK#YBz-njyY5v8QTs93aId5CtXDblPqkUmbO8xCAET_4fw) and unzip its contents into `data`. Rename the root folder of the unzipped file to `SibenikDataset`.
2. Download the MaCVi [Object Detection v2 dataset](https://cloud.cs.uni-tuebingen.de/index.php/s/ZZxX65FGnQ8zjBP) and unzip its contents into a folder named `data`.
3. Download the [Kaggle ship classification dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vinayakshanawad/ships-dataset) and unzip its contents into a folder named `data`. Rename the root folder of the unzipped file to `shipdataset`.
4. Download the official DL challenge dataset and extract its contents into a folder named `data/CombinedDatasetsChallenge`.
5. Run all cells of the `make_dataset.ipynb` and `make_sibenik_data.ipynb` notebooks. This should create a new folder `data/CombinedDatasets` with the merged data.
6. Run `cd data && bash combine_v15.sh`.
7. Run `sbatch run_e6.sh` on the TCML cluster.
